# Lesson Plan: Conditional Tests in Python

## Overview
In this lesson, students will learn how to use **conditional tests** in Python, focusing on equality, inequality, case-insensitive comparisons, logical operators, and membership testing. The lesson aligns with the **Michigan K-12 Computer Science Standards**.

## Key Terms and Concepts
- **Conditional test**: Evaluating whether a condition is true or false.
- **Equality**: Checking if two values are equal.
- **Inequality**: Comparing two values for inequality.
- **Lower() method**: A method to convert a string to lowercase.
- **Logical operators**: `and` and `or` for combining conditions.
- **Membership testing**: Using `in` to check if a value is in a list.

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Lesson Hook (1 - 2 minutes)
- **Activity**: Show students two strings (e.g., `"apple"` and `"Apple"`) and ask if they are equal.
- **Discussion**: Why might we need to compare strings in different ways?

### 2. Mini Lesson (8 - 10 minutes)
- **Topic**: Conditional tests in Python.
- **Content**:
    - Equality and inequality using `==` and `!=`.
    - Case-insensitive comparison using `.lower()`.
    - Logical operators (`and`, `or`) for combining conditions.
    - Membership testing with `in`.

### 3. Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- **Activity 1**: Write a program that compares two numbers for equality.
- **Activity 2**: Given a list of fruits, use `in` to check if a specific fruit is present.
- **Activity 3**: Combine conditions using `and` and `or`.

### 4. Station Rotation (20 minutes)
- **Station 1**: Create a list of programming languages. Check if a language is in the list.
- **Station 2**: Given a sentence, write a function to count the number of vowels.
- **Station 3**: Compare two strings (case-insensitive) and print a message based on their equality.

### 5. Activities (10 minutes)
- **Activity 1**: Students work in pairs to create their own conditional tests.
- **Activity 2**: Discuss the results as a class.

### 6. Independent Practice (5 minutes)
- **Task**: Write a program that checks if a user-provided username is valid (meets certain criteria).

### 7. Assessment
- **Task**: Provide students with a list of numbers and ask them to find the odd ones using conditional tests.

### 8. Differentiation
- **Advanced Students**: Challenge them to write complex conditions involving multiple operators.
- **Struggling Students**: Provide additional examples and scaffolded code.

### 9. Discussion Questions
1. *Why is it important to consider case-insensitivity when comparing strings?*
    - **Answer**: Ensures accurate comparisons regardless of letter case.
2. *How can we use logical operators to combine conditions?*
    - **Answer**: `and` requires both conditions to be true, while `or` requires at least one to be true.
