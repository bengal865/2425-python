# Project Title

## Overview

> In this project, you'll take an existing Python text game and add a few new features to it.

## Suggested Changes

Some possible changes you could make to the original game:

 - Ask the user if they want to go left, right or straight ahead
 - Instead of offering the player a pot of gold, add another room and ask the user if they want to exit the new room through the blue door or the red door
 - Use a loop to make sure the player can't continue with the game until they choose an option for exiting the new room (blue door OR red door)
 - Give the user a point and build in new levels and challenge questions every time they go through one door (or the other)
 
## All done?
Save your work to your H: drive as:
_improved_maze_game.py_

## Helpful Hints

 - Write down in advance what you want your script to do
 - Will you need any new variables to store data?
 - What about using a list instead of lots of variables? 
 - **Use at least one custom/user-defined function**
 - Use the built-in Python functions you've already learned about  
    * input ( )
    * float ( ) 
    * int ( ) 
- Consider using a few of the Python methods you've used before, such as:
    * append ( )
    * lower ( )
    * title ( )
 - Comment out code instead of deleting it in case you take your game in a direction that doesn't work; then you can return to a version of your code that DOES work
