# Passing Values Between Python Functions

## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:

 - return a value FROM a function
 - pass an argument -- a value -- TO a parameter so the function can perform its assigned task
 - define and use a main ( ) function in your script

 # Hints

 * What built-in methods and functions can you use to manage Python lists?
 * How do you create an **empty** list in Python?
 * What is the purpose of the **main ( )** function?
 * Python f-strings are your BFF!

## Activity #1
* Write a script that uses custom (user-defined) functions to calculate and display the area of a rectangle
    * Write one function that gets and returns the LENGTH of the rectangle from the user
    * Write a second function that gets and returns the WIDTH of the rectangle from the user
    * Write a third function that calculates and returns the AREA of the rectangle
    * Write a fourth function that displays the dimensions and area of the rectangle
    * Place your function calls in a mother function named main
    * Run your script by calling the function named main


 
## Activity #2
 - Write a function named _get_scores_ that uses a WHILE loop to fill an empty list called _scores_ with five quiz scores
 - Return the list of scores from the _get_scores_ function
 - Write a second function the finds and returns the SUM of the quiz scores
 - Write a third function that calculates and returns the AVERAGE quiz score
 - Your last function should use the return values from the other functions to display the quiz scores, the number of quiz scores, and the average quiz score

## All done?

 - Be prepared to share and discuss your scripts with the rest of the class
