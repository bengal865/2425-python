# Practice:  Finding the MINIMUM Value in a Python List

## Overview
In this practice project, you'll:
- use the Python `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list of numbers
- use the Python `sum()` function to find the sum of all the numbers in a list of numbers

## Code Snippet
Check out the following code snippet.  Be prepared to explain in simple terms what the code
generally does or specific lines of code do.
```python
def find_max_value(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        print('Sorry, but your list is empty!')
    else:
        return max(numbers)

# Example usage:
my_numbers = [20, 12, 18, 24, 36, 22]
max_value = find_max_value(my_numbers)
print(f"The maximum value is: {max_value}")
```
