## Lesson Plan 1: Introduction to Python Lists (45 minutes)
**Grade Level:** 11th & 12th Grade (AP Computer Science Principles)
**Michigan State Standards:** CP.A2.2.2, CP.A2.3.1, CP.A3.2.2
**Key Terms and Concepts:**
- List
- Index
- Accessing elements
- Mutability
**Lesson Outline:**
**Introduction (Hook - 5 minutes):**
- Play a quick game of "Would you rather?" with a twist! Instead of two choices, present three options that involve organizing items. (e.g., Organize your music library alphabetically, by genre, or by artist?) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
-   Introduce the concept of lists in Python as a way to organize collections of items in a specific order.
**Mini Lesson (10 minutes):**
-   Explain how to create lists using square brackets \[\] and separate elements with commas.
-   Demonstrate accessing individual elements using index notation list\[index\], emphasizing that indexing starts at 0.
-   Show examples of printing specific elements and the entire list using print().

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**
1.  (5 minutes) Have students write Python code to create lists containing different data types (numbers, strings, etc.).
2.  (10 minutes) Students practice accessing elements at different positions using indexing. They can write code to print the first element, last element, and an element in the middle.
**Station Rotations (10 minutes - Dr. Catlin Tucker's Model):**
1.  **List Builders:** Students practice creating lists with various data types and write code to access specific elements.
2.  **Mystery List:** Provide a pre-written list with different elements and ask students to write code to print specific information, like the third element or the sum of all numbers in the list.
3.  **List Challenge:** Challenge students to create a list representing their favorite movie collection and write code to access details about a particular movie (e.g., title of the second movie).
**Activities (5 minutes):**
-   Exit ticket: Students write a short reflection on what they learned about lists and indexing.
**Independent Practice (Homework - 10 minutes):**
-   Have students write a Python program to create a list of their favorite foods and then print the entire list and the name of their second favorite food.
**Assessment:**
-   Observe student participation during guided practice and station rotations.
-   Review exit tickets and homework assignments.
**Differentiation:**
-   **Advanced Students:** Challenge them to explore negative indexing and slicing to access sub-lists.
-   **Struggling Students:** Provide scaffolded activities with pre-written code snippets for them to complete.
