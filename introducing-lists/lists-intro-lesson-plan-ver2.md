Lesson Plan 1: Intro to Python Lists (45 minutes)

**Key Terms and Concepts:**

*   List
    
*   Index
    
*   Ordered Collection
    
*   Mutable (Changeable) Data Structure
    

**Lesson Outline:**

**Introduction (Hook - 5 minutes)**

*   Play a quick game of "Would you Rather?" with a twist. Ask students two scenarios where they would need to organize a collection of items. (e.g., Packing a backpack for school vs. packing a suitcase for vacation). Discuss the advantages of having an organized list for each scenario.
    

**Mini Lesson (8 minutes)**

*   Introduce the concept of a list as an ordered collection of items in Python.
    
*   Demonstrate creating a simple list using square brackets \[Â  \] and separating items with commas.
    
*   Show how to print the entire list using print().

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**

*   (5 minutes) Kick off a pair-and-share activity where students create lists for different scenarios (e.g., grocery shopping list, favorite movies list, video game characters).
    
*   (10 minutes) Instruct students to write a short Python program that creates a list of their favorite hobbies and then prints each hobby using a for loop. (Teacher circulates to provide support)
    

**Station Rotations (12 minutes - 3 minutes per station):**

*   Station 1: List Challenge (Students are given pre-written code with a list containing errors. They need to identify and fix the errors).
    
*   Station 2: Mystery List (Students use print statements strategically to guess what's inside a predefined list).
    
*   Station 3: List Relay (Students take turns adding or removing items from a list based on teacher instructions).
    

**Activities (5 minutes):**

*   Have students reflect on the similarities and differences between lists and strings in Python (both are ordered collections, but lists can hold different data types).
    

**Independent Practice (5 minutes):**

*   Assign students a short independent coding activity where they create a list to represent their favorite music playlist and then find the length of the list using the len() function.
    

**Assessment:**

*   Review student code from the guided practice and independent practice activities.
    
*   Observe students' participation during station rotations.
    

**Differentiation:**

*   **Advanced Students:** Challenge them to create a program that sorts their list of hobbies alphabetically or by another criteria.
    
*   **Struggling Students:** Provide them with pre-written code templates for the guided practice activities.
    

**Discussion Questions:**

*   Why is the order of items important in a list?
    
*   How can lists be used to make our programs more organized?
    

**Alignment with Michigan CS Standards:**

*   CT.01.01.b - Demonstrate proficiency in creating and manipulating data structures (lists).
    

**Lesson Plan 2: Adventures in Indexing (45 minutes)**
------------------------------------------------------

**Key Terms and Concepts:**

*   Index
    
*   Accessing List Elements
    
*   Positive and Negative Indexing
    
*   Slicing
    

**Lesson Outline:**

**Introduction (Hook - 5 minutes)**

*   Present a scrambled list of movie quotes and challenge students to put them in the correct order. Discuss the importance of knowing the position of each quote.
    

**Mini Lesson (8 minutes)**

*   Introduce the concept of indexing in Python lists. Explain how each item has a unique position (index) starting from 0.
    
*   Demonstrate how to access specific elements in a list using their index within square brackets \[\].
    

**Resources:**

*   [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_lists\_access.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
    
*   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-slicing/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-slicing/)
    

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**

*   (5 minutes) Students complete a worksheet with practice problems on accessing elements from a list using positive indexing.
    
*   (10 minutes) Introduce negative indexing (starting from the end of the list) and slicing (extracting a sublist) with examples. Students practice using these techniques in pairs.
    

**Station Rotations (12 minutes - 3 minutes per station):**

*   Station 1: Index Hunt (Students are given a list and a set of instructions to find specific elements using indexing and slicing).
    
*   Station 2: Secret Message (Students write a short program to decode a scrambled message stored in a list using slicing).
    
*   Station 3: List Builders (Students take turns adding or removing elements from a list based on specific index positions).
    

**Activities (5 minutes):**

*   Have students brainstorm real-world scenarios where indexing lists would be useful (e.g., accessing song titles in a music playlist based on their position).
