**Python Lists Unit: A Three-Lesson Journey**

## Lesson 1: Getting to Know Python Lists (45 minutes)

- **Key Terms & Concepts:** List, Index, Ordered Collection, Mutable

**Introduction (Hook- 5 minutes):**

- Playa quick game of "Would you Rather?"with a twist, highlighting the need for organized lists in different scenarios (e.g., packing for school vs. packing for vacation).

**Mini Lesson (8 minutes):**

- Introduce lists as ordered collections of items in Python.
- Demonstrate creating lists using square brackets [] and separating items with commas.
- Show how to print the entire list using print().

**Resources:**

- <https://realpython.com/lessons/list-methods/>
- <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp>

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**

- (5 minutes) Introduce a pair-and-share activity where students create lists for different scenarios (e.g., groceries, movies, video game characters).
- (10 minutes) Students write a program to create a list of hobbies and print each hobby using a for loop (with help from the teacher).

**Station Rotations (12 minutes - 3 minutes per station):**

- Station 1: List Challenge (Identify and correct errors in pre-written code that uses lists).
- Station 2: Mystery List (Use print statements to guess what's inside a predefined list).
- Station 3: List Relay (Take turns adding/removing items from a list per instructions).

**Activities (5 minutes):**

- Discuss similarities and differences between lists and strings (both are ordered collections, but lists can hold different data types).

**Independent Practice (5 minutes):**

- Create a list representing your favorite music playlist and find its length using the len()function. 

**Assessment:**
- Review student code from guided and independent practice activities.
- Observe participation during station rotations.

  **Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Sort the hobbies list alphabetically or using another criterion.
- **Struggling Students:** Provide code templates for guided practice activities.

**Discussion Questions:**

- Why is the order of items important in a list?
- How can lists help make scripts more organized?

## Lesson 2: Adventures in Indexing (45 minutes)

- **Key Terms and Concepts:** Index, Accessing Elements, Positive/Negative Indexing, Slicing **Introduction (Hook- 5 minutes):**
- Present a scrambled list of movie quotes and challenge students to put them in the correct order, emphasizing the importance of knowing element positions.

  **Mini Lesson (8 minutes):**

- Introduce indexing in Python lists, emphasizing that each item has a unique position (index)starting from 0.
- Demonstrate accessing elements using their index within square brackets [].

**Resources:**

- <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp>
- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-slicing/>

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**

- (5 minutes) Complete a worksheet with practice problems on accessing elements using positive indexing.
- (10 minutes) Introduce negative indexing (starting from the end) and slicing (extracting a sublist) with examples. Students practice in pairs.

**Station Rotations (12 minutes - 3 minutes perstation):**

- Station 1: Index Hunt (Find specific elements in a list using indexing and slicing).
- Station 2: Secret Message (Write a program to decode a scrambled message stored in a list using slicing).
- Station 3: List Builders (Take turns adding/removing elements from a list based on specific indexpositions).

**Activities (5 minutes):**

- Brainstorm real-world situations where indexing lists would be useful (e.g., accessing song titles in a playlist).

**Independent Practice (5 minutes):**

- Create a list of favorite books and use indexing to print the title of specific books

## Lesson 3: Mastering the List (45 minutes)

- **Key Terms and Concepts:** Modifying Lists, append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), sorted(), how to reverse lists

**Introduction (Hook- 5 minutes):**

- Present a list of steps for a recipe that is out of order. Challenge students to determine the correct order and explain why order matters when following instructions.

**Mini Lesson (8 minutes):**

- Discuss how lists in Python are mutable (changeable).
- Introduce methods for modifying lists:
  - append() to add elements to the end.
  - insert() to insert elements at a specific position.
  - remove() to delete elements by value.
  - pop() to remove elements byindex.
- Briefly introduce the sort() method for in-place sorting and the sorted()function for creating a **new** sorted list.
- Demonstrate how use slicing to reverse the order of list elements.

**Resources:**

- <https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_insert.asp>
- <https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_remove.asp>

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**

- (5 minutes) Students complete a coding exercise where they practice adding and removing elements from a predefined list using various list methods.
- (10 minutes) Students write a program that:
- Creates a list of random numbers.
- Sorts the list in ascending order using sort().
- Prints the reversed version of the sorted list. (Teacher will assist the class)

**Station Rotations (12 minutes - 3 minutes perstation):**

- Station 1: List Chef (Write a program to modify a recipe list based on user input - add/remove ingredients).
- Station 2: List Organizer (Practice sorting and reversing pre-defined lists using the methods introduced).
- Station 3: Mystery List Remix (Modify and reorder a scrambled list using different methods).

**Activities (5 minutes):**

- Discuss the importance of avoiding index errors when working with lists (e.g., accessing elements outside the list's boundaries).

**Independent Practice (5 minutes):**

- Create a list of your top 5 vacation destinations and use the sort() method to sort them based on your preferred sequence of destinations.

**Assessment:**

- Review student code from guided and independent practice activities.
- Observe participation during station rotations.

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Write a program to find the minimum and maximum values in a list without using built-in functions.
- **Struggling Students:** Provide code templates with missing method calls and ask them to complete the code to arrange the list elements in the desired sequence.

**Discussion Questions:**

- What are some potential consequences of index errors?
- How can sorting and reversing lists be helpful in certain situations?
