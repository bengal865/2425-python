# Lesson Plan 2: Python Lists - Beyond Basics

## Key Terms & Concepts:

- List methods (e.g., append(), extend(), insert())

- List comprehension

## List iteration using loops

## Lesson Outline:- Introduction (Hook) (5 minutes)

- Recap the basics of Python lists.

- Discuss the importance of dynamic data structures.

## Mini Lesson: List Methods (10 minutes)

> Introduce common list methods:

- append(): Add an element to the end of a list.

- extend(): Combine two lists.

- insert(): Insert an element at a specific index.

- Provide examples for each method.

## Resources:

- Python List Methods

- Real Python: List Comprehensions

## Guided Practice (15 minutes)

- Demonstrate how to use list methods.

- Students practice adding, extending, and inserting elements.

## Station Rotation (20 minutes)

Set up stations with activities related to list methods:

- **Station 1**: Using append()

- **Station 2**: Combining lists with extend()

- **Station 3**: Inserting elements with insert()

## Activities (5 minutes)

Students share what they learned by completing their station rotations.

## Independent Practice (10 minutes)

- Assign a coding task involving list methods.

## Assessment:

- Quiz on list methods.

## Differentiation:

- Advanced students can explore list comprehension.

- Struggling students can focus on mastering basic list methods.

## Discussion Questions:

- What's the most efficient way to add elements to a list?

- What are the benefits of using list comprehension?
