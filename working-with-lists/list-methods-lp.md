# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python Lists

## Key Terms and Concepts:
- list
- element
- index number
- accessing list elements
- list slicing

## Lesson Outline:

### Introduction (Hook) (5 minutes)
    - Show students a list of items (e.g., fruits) and ask them how they would organize these items.
    - Introduce the concept of lists and explain their importance in programming.
### Mini Lesson: Accessing List Elements (10 minutes)
    - Discuss how to access individual elements in a list using index numbers.
    - Demonstrate list indexing and slicing.
    - Provide examples of accessing specific elements.
### Resources:
    - Python lists documentation
    - Codecademy: Python Lists
### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
    - Students practice accessing elements from predefined lists.
    - Work through examples together as a class.
### Station Rotation (20 minutes)
    - Set up stations where students explore different list-related activities:
        - Station 1: Indexing practice
        - Station 2: Slicing practice
        - Station 3: Solving problems using lists
### Activities (5 minutes)
    - Students share their findings from the station rotations.
### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
    - Assign a small coding challenge related to list indexing or slicing.
### Assessment:
    - Quiz on list indexing and slicing.
### Differentiation:
    - Advanced students can explore multidimensional lists.
    - Struggling students can focus on basic list indexing.
### Discussion Questions:
    - Why are lists important in programming?
    - How can you avoid index errors when working with lists?
