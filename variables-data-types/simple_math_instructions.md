# Simple Math in Python

## Objectives

Students will learn to:

- perform simple calculations in Python
- identify the math operators in Python
- apply the order of operations to math calculations (PEMDAS)

## Helpful Resources

 1. [Python math operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_arithmetic_operators.asp)
 2. [Python assignment operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

## General Requirements

- Add a comment block to the top of your script
```python
# Abe Lincoln
# 21 APR 20XX
# Intro to Python Variables
```
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Sprinkle short, specific comments throughout your code
- Use short, descriptive names for your files
- Name your files in lowercase

## Basic Math in Python

### Script 1
Write a script that:

 - prompts the user to enter the `length` and `width` of a rectangular room
 - uses the `float()` function to convert the user's input to floats (numbers with a decimal point)
 - displays the **AREA** of the room (in square feet)
 - displays the **PERIMETER** of the room (in feet)
 - uses *f-strings* to display the area and perimeter of the room

### Script 2
Write a script that:

- prompts the user to enter two numbers
- converts the user's input to floats (numbers with a decimal point)
- uses the **modulus operator** to find the remainder of a division problem 

Divide one number by the other and show the equation and the remainder in your console.

### Script 3
- In your prompts and output, include the correct units of measure (feet, square feet, etc.)
- Define a constant, **PI**, and assign it the value `3.14159`
- Then create the variables and use the constant `PI` to calculate and display the area of a circle
- Prompt the user to enter the length of the circle's radius (in **feet**)
- Convert the user's input to a float using Python's built-in `float()` function
- Display the area of the cirlce in **square feet**
