# Intro to Python Strings

## Objective

> - Students will learn how to assign a string to a Python variable
> - Students will use the `input ( )` function to get input from the user
> - Students will convert user input to integers and floats using the built-in Python `int( )` and `float(  )` functions

## Submitting Your Work
- Create a GitHub repository: `strings-practice-python`
- Upload your script to your repo
- Submit the URL that points to your repo on Google Classroom

## General Specifications

- Add a comment block to your script
```python

- Use short, descriptive filenames
- Write your filenames in lowercase

## Resources & Examples

- [Python strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
- [How to concatenate strings in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_concatenate.asp)

## Writing Your Script

- Show you know how to *concatenate* strings
    - Assign your first and last name to two string variables
    - Create a third variable `full_name`
    - Use the concatenation operator (+) to assign your first and last names to the variable `full_name`
    - Then use concatenation to print your first name in a sentence, your last name in a sentence, and your full name in a sentence
- Show you know how to use the `input ()` function to get input from the user, i.e., prompt the user to enter information
    - Define a variable `city` and then use the input function to ask the user which city in Michigan they live in
    - Use concatenation to display a sentence that says which city the user lives in
    - Define a variable `hourly_wage` and use the `float()` and `input()` functions together to ask the user what their hourly wage is at Burger King; also use the `input()` function to get the user's first name; use concatenation to build a custom string that includes the user's first name and hourly wage
      > Example: `Mikey earns $14.50 an hour at Burger King.`
