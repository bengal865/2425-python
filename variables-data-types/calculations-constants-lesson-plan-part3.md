## Lesson Plan 3: Performing Calculations and Using Constants (45 minutes)

**Target Audience:** 11th & 12th Grade Computer Science students

**Topic:** Performing Calculations and Using Constants in Python 

**Michigan State CS Standard:** C.P.5.2

- Perform simple mathematical calculations using Python.

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- Mathematical Operators (+, -, \*, /, %)
- Modulus Operator (%)
- Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
- Constant

**Lesson Outline:**

**Hook (5 minutes):**

- Present a real-world scenario involving calculations (e.g., calculating total bill including sales tax).
- Briefly discuss how Python can be used to perform such calculations.

**Mini Lesson (15 minutes):**

- **Mathematical Operations** - Introduce basic mathematical operators in Python (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Demonstrate their use with code examples (e.g., result = 5 + 3, answer = 10 / 2).
- **Introduce the Modulus Operator (%)** - Explain how the modulus operator finds the remainder after division (e.g., remainder = 14 % 3).
- **Order of Operations (PEMDAS)** - Briefly review the order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) using Python expressions.

**Guided Practice (20 minutes):**

- **Activity 1** (10 minutes): Students work in pairs to write Python code that performs various mathematical operations with different data types (e.g., integers, floats).
- **Activity 2** (10 minutes): Introduce the concept of constants. Explain how constants are variables with fixed values that cannot be changed during program execution (e.g., PI = 3.14159). Demonstrate creating constants using uppercase variable names by convention.
  - Students practice using constants in their code for calculations (e.g., area\_of\_circle = **PI** \* radius\*\*2).

**Activities (5 minutes):**

- Calculator Challenge **(5 minutes)**: The teacher displays simple math expressions on the board (e.g., 2 \* (3 + 5)). Students take turns evaluating the expressions mentally or using calculators, considering the order of operations.

**Independent Practice (10 minutes):**

- Students write a Python script that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. They should prompt the user for the rectangle's length and width (using input()), perform the calculations, and display the results with appropriate labels. Encourage them to use constants for values like **pi** (for area calculations).

**Assessment:**

- Review student work from the Guided Practice and Independent Practice activities.
- Observe student participation in class discussions and activities.

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Challenge them to explore more complex calculations (e.g., volume of geometric shapes) and explore built-in math functions (e.g., round()).
- **Struggling Students:** Provide scaffolding with pre-written code examples or use a step-by-step approach for calculations. Provide one-on-one assistance during practice activities.
