# Remember: A variable is just a container that holds
# (stores) a piece of data

# Define a variable named first_name and
# store the value 'Jennifer' inside it
# first_name = 'Jennifer'
first_name = "Jennifer"

# Use the print ( ) function to display the value
# currently stored inside the variable first_name
print(first_name)
