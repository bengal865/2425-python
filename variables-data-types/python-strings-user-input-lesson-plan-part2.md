# Lesson Plan: Working with Strings and User Input (45 minutes)

**Target Audience:** 11th & 12th Grade Computer Science students
**Topic:** String Manipulation and User Input in Python 
**Michigan State CS Standard:** C.P.5.1

- Design and implement programs that use variables to store and manipulate data.

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- String
- String Concatenation (+)
- f-strings
- String Formatting (.format())
- User Input (input())
- int() function (converting strings to integers)
- float() function (converting strings to floats)

**Lesson Outline:**

**Introduction (Hook - 5 minutes):**

- Play a quick word scramble game with programming-related terms (e.g., STRING, VARIABLE, FUNCTION).
- Discuss how strings are used to store and manipulate text data in Python.

**Mini Lesson (10 minutes):**

- String Concatenation - Demonstrate how to combine strings using the + operator (e.g., first\_name = "Alice", last\_name = "Smith", full\_name = first\_name + " " + last\_name).
- Introduce f-strings - Explain the use of f-strings for formatted string literals with variables embedded (e.g., greeting = f"Hello, {full\_name}!").
- String Formatting - Briefly cover the .format() method for string formatting (e.g., message = "Your age is {}.".format(age)).

**Guided Practice (20 minutes):**

- Activity 1 (10 minutes): Students work in pairs to write Python code that uses string 
  concatenation and f-strings to create greetings or messages for different scenarios.
- Activity 2 (10 minutes): Introduce the input() function for user input. Demonstrate how to convert user input (strings) to numeric data types (integers and floats) using the int() and float() functions (e.g., age = int(input("Enter your age: "))).
- Students practice using input() and conversion functions in short code examples.

**Activities (10 minutes):**

- Story Builder (5 minutes): The class works together to write a short story, taking turns adding sentences or phrases. Each student contributes a string element to the story.
- Mad Libs (5 minutes): Students work in pairs to complete a Mad Libs template using Python string manipulation techniques (e.g., concatenation, f-strings).

**Independent Practice (10 minutes):**

- Students create a Python program that prompts the user for their name and age (using input()). They then use string manipulation and the conversion functions (int() or float()) to create a personalized message that includes the user's name and age.

**Assessment:**

- Review student work from the Guided Practice and Independent Practice activities.
- Observe student participation in class discussions and activities.

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Challenge them to explore advanced string methods (e.g., upper(), lower(), split()) and user input validation (checking for valid numeric input).
- **Struggling Students:** Provide additional support with string manipulation syntax and conversion functions. Offer scaffolding with code templates during practice activities.
