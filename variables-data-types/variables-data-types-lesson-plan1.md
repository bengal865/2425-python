# Programming Concepts Lesson Plan

## Introduction (10 min):
- **Objective**: Introduce basic programming concepts.
- **Description**: Briefly discuss what programming is and how it's used.

## What is programming? (Warm-up)
- **Objective**: Understand the concept of variables in Python.
- **Description**: Introduce variables as named containers for data.

## Numeric Data Types (10 min)
- **Objective**: Understand the use of different variable types in run-time system dynamics and efficiency.
- **Description**: Demonstrate integer (whole numbers) and float (decimals) with examples. Discuss mutable vs. immutable data structures and storage classes (stack vs. heap).

## String Data Types (10 min)
- **Objective**: Apply understanding of string data types using study datasets during class time.
- **Description**: Students will explore code examples using strings (e.g., names, greetings).

## Boolean Data Types (10 min)
- **Objective**: Apply understanding of Boolean data types using study datasets during class time.
- **Description**: Students will explore code examples using Booleans (e.g., true/false statements like alarm status, weather condition).

## Wrap-up (10 min):
- **Objective**: Review key concepts and consolidate learning through a mini-project.
- **Description**: Briefly summarize variable types and introduce a small coding challenge to students (e.g., calculate area, create a Mad Libs game).
