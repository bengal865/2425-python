# Remember: A variable is just a container that holds
# (stores) a piece of data, such as a name or someone's age

# Define a variable called first_name and
# store the value 'Melissa' inside it
first_name = 'Melissa' # Don't forget the quotation marks around the name!
# first_name = "Melissa"
# first_name = "Mike"

# Define a second variable named age and
# assign the value 24 to it
age = 24

# Use the print ( ) function to display a sentence
# containing the person's name and age
print(f'{first_name} is {age} years old.')
print(f"{first_name} is {age} years old.")
