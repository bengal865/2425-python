# Lesson Plan 3: Performing Calculations and Using Constants (45 minutes)

**Target Audience**: 11th & 12th Grade Computer Science  
**Topic**: Performing Calculations and Using Constants in Python  
**Michigan State CS Standard**: C.P.5.2 - Implement simple mathematical computations using Python.

## Key Terms and Concepts
- **Mathematical Operators** (+, -, *, /, %)
- **Modulus Operator** (%)
- **Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**
- **Constant**

## Lesson Outline

### Introduction (Hook - 5 minutes):
- Present a real-world scenario involving calculations (e.g., calculating total bill amount with tax).
- Briefly discuss how Python can be used to perform these calculations.

### Mini Lesson (15 minutes):
1. **Mathematical Operations**:
   - Introduce basic mathematical operators in Python (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Demonstrate their use with code examples (e.g., `result = 5 + 3`, `answer = 10 / 2`).
2. **Introduce the Modulus Operator (%)**:
   - Explain how the modulus operator finds the remainder after division (e.g., `remainder = 14 % 3`).
3. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**:
   - Briefly review the order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) using Python expressions.

- [W3Schools Python Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

### Guided Practice (20 minutes):
1. **Activity 1 (10 minutes)**:
   - Students work in pairs to write Python code that performs various mathematical operations with different data types (e.g., integers, floats).
2. **Activity 2 (10 minutes)**:
   - Introduce the concept of constants.
   - Explain how constants are variables with fixed values that cannot be changed during program execution (e.g., `PI = 3.14159`).
   - Demonstrate creating constants using uppercase variable names by convention.
   - Students practice using constants in their code for calculations (e.g., `area_of_circle = PI * radius**2`).
