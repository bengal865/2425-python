## Lesson Plan 1: Introduction to Python Variables and Data Types (PRIMM Model - 45 minutes)
**Target Audience:** 11th & 12th Grade Computer Science students

**Topic:** Introduction to Python Variables and Data Types 

**Michigan State CS Standard:** C.P.5.1 - Design and implement programs that use variables to store and manipulate data.

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- Variable
- Data Type (String, Integer, Float, Boolean)

**PRIMM Model Steps:**

**Predict (10 minutes):**

- Show students a short piece of Python code with variable declarations (e.g., name = "Alice", age = 15).
- In pairs, have students predict what kind of data each variable holds (String for name, Integer for age).
- Discuss their predictions as a class and clarify any misconceptions.

**Run (5 minutes):**

- Run the provided code snippet together as a class.
- Observe the output and confirm (or correct) the data types students predicted for each variable based on the printed results.

**Investigate (15 minutes):**

- Introduce the concept of variables as containers for data and naming conventions (lowercase letters, underscores).
- Explain different data types (string, integer, float, Boolean) and their uses with real-world examples.
- Demonstrate the assignment operator (=) using code examples (e.g., pi = 3.14, is_raining = True).

**Modify (10 minutes):**

- Provide students with a code template with a variable declaration (e.g., answer =).
- Challenge them to modify the code by assigning different data types (string, integer, float, Boolean) to the variable and predict the output.
- Students run their modified code and compare the results to their predictions.

**Make (5 minutes):**

- Briefly introduce the concept of printing variable values using the print() function.
- In pairs, students create short Python in which they declare variables of different data types and assign values to those variables. They then use print() function to display the variable names and their values.

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Challenge students to write scripts with multiple variables and explore additional data type conversions (e.g., int() for converting strings to integers).
- **Struggling Students:** Provide scaffolding with pre-filled variable names and data types. Offer one-on-one guidance during the Modify and Make stages.

**Assessment:**

- Observe student participation during discussions and predictions in the Predict stage.
- Review student work from the Modify and Make activities.
