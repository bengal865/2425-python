**Lesson Plan 1: Introduction to Loop Control in Python (45 minutes) Grade Level:** 11th &12th Grade

**Subject:** Computer Science

**Topic:** Using break and continue with while loops in Python **Michigan State Standards:**

- CPS.K-12.CT.2.2.1 - Use control flow mechanisms (conditionals, loops) in algorithms and procedures.
- CPS.K-12.CT.2.4.3 - Implement problem solutions using common programming languages and libraries.

**Key Terms and Concepts:**

- while loop
- break statement
- continue statement
- Iteration
- Loop control

**Lesson Outline: Hook (1-2 minutes):**

- Show a short video of a game loop in action (e.g., [YouTube Pac-Man ghost movement]). Ask students what makes the ghosts keep moving around the maze? (They repeat their movement pattern in a loop).

**Mini Lesson (8-10 minutes):**

- Briefly review the purpose of a while loop and how it iterates based on a condition.
- Introduce the concept of loop control: sometimes we want to exit a loop early or skip a specific iteration.
- Explain that break and continue are keywords used for loop control in Python.

**Guided Practice (20 minutes):**

- **Activity 1 (10 minutes):** Students explore the break statement with a scaffolded code example. The code iterates through a list of numbers and prints them until it reaches a specific value. Students add a break statement to exit the loop at that value. (Teacher facilitates and answers questions)
- **Activity 2 (10 minutes):** Similar to Activity 1, but students explore the continue statement. The code iterates through a list and skips printing even numbers using continue. (Teacher guides students and checks their understanding)

**Station Rotations (15 minutes):**

- **Station 1: Break the Loop! (5 minutes):** Students are given a set of incomplete Python code snippets with while loops. They need to identify where to use break to achieve a desired outcome (e.g., stop the loop after a certain number of iterations).
- **Station 2: Continue the Fun! (5 minutes):** Similar to Station 1, but students use continue to modify code snippets. For example, skip printing negative numbers in a

  loop.

- **Station 3: Debugging Challenge (5 minutes):** Students work in pairs to debug provided code with incorrect break or continue usage. They need to fix the code to achieve the intended behavior.

**Activities (Optional, 5 minutes):**

- Quick quiz to assess basic understanding of break and continue.

**Independent Practice (Homework, 10 minutes estimated):**

- Students complete a worksheet with exercises that involve writing Python code using break and continue with while loops.

**Assessment:**

- Observe student participation during guided practice and station rotations.
- Review completed worksheets and quizzes.

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced Students:** Can work on creating their own loop control challenges for others.
- **Struggling Students:** Provide additional scaffolded code examples and one-on-one support during guided practice.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. When would you use break in a while loop? (Possible Answer: To exit the loop early when a specific condition is met).
1. What is the difference between break and continue? (Possible Answer: break exits the loop completely, while continue skips the current iteration and continues to the next).
3. Can you think of a real-world scenario where loop control might be useful? (Possible Answer: Video game character movement, processing data until a certain criteria is met).
