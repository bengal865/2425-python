# Lesson Plan: Storing Functions in  Python Modules
**Key Terms & Concepts:**
- **Module**: A file containing Python code (functions, classes, or variables) that can be imported into other Python programs.
- **Import Statement**: Used to bring modules or specific functions from modules into your Python program.
- **Alias**: An alternative name assigned to a module or function during import using the as keyword.
- **Namespace**: The scope where names (such as function names or variable names) are defined and can be accessed.
## Lesson Outline:
1. **Lesson Hook (1 - 2 minutes)**:
   1. Start by asking students if they’ve ever used external libraries or packages in their Python programs. Discuss why modular code is essential for efficient programming.
1. **Mini Lesson (8 - 10 minutes)**:
   1. **Importing an Entire Module**:
      1. Explain that modules allow us to organize our code better.
      1. Demonstrate how to import an entire module using the import statement.
      1. Show examples with common modules like math or random.
1. **Guided Practice (10 minutes)**:
   1. **Importing Specific Functions**:
      1. Discuss scenarios where importing the entire module might be inefficient.
      1. Teach students how to import specific functions using the from keyword.
      1. Practice importing specific functions from a custom module (e.g., my_module.py).
1. **Station Rotation (15 minutes)**:
   1. Divide students into groups and set up stations:
      1. **Alias Station**:
         1. Explain the concept of aliases.
         1. Show how to import a function with an alias using the as keyword.
      1. **Module Alias Station**:
         1. Discuss the benefits of module aliases.
         1. Demonstrate how to import a module with an alias.
      1. **Practice Station**:
         1. Provide exercises for students to practice importing functions and modules.
         1. Include scenarios where they need to use aliases.
1. **Activities (5 minutes)**:
   1. Ask students to create their own Python module (e.g., student\_module.py) with a few functions.
   1. In pairs, they should import each other’s modules and use the functions.
1. **Independent Practice (5 minutes)**:
   1. Students work individually:
      1. Import the datetime module.
      1. Use the datetime.datetime.now() function to display the current date and time.
1. **Assessment (5 minutes)**:
   1. Give students a short quiz on module-related concepts (e.g., “What’s the purpose of using aliases?”).
1. **Differentiation (Advanced and Struggling Students)**:
   1. **Advanced**:
      1. Challenge them to explore third-party Python packages (e.g., requests, numpy).
      1. Discuss how to install and use external packages.
   1. **Struggling**:
      1. Provide additional examples and guided practice.
      1. Offer extra time for practice.
1. **Discussion Questions**:
   1. *Why is modular code important in programming?*
      1. **Answer**: Modular code is easier to read, reuse and maintain.
   1. *How can you import only specific functions from a module?*
      1. **Answer**: Use the from module\_name import function\_name syntax.
   1. *What’s the purpose of using aliases during import?*
      1. **Answer**: Aliases make code more concise and prevent naming conflicts.
