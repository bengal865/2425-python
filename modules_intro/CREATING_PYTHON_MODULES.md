# Intro to Python Modules

## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:

 * create a Python module
 * call functions in your script that are stored in your module

 - _Python Crash Course_, pp. 150 - 154 (_Storing Your Functions in Modules_)
 
## Directions

 * Create two Python files -- one for your module, the other for your script
 

 > Save your module as **myfunctions.py**
 
 > Save your script as **areacalcs.py**
* Use an **import** statement to link your module to your **areacalcs.py** script
* In your module, write functions to calculate the area of any THREE of the following shapes:
    * circle
    * square
    * rectangle
    * right triangle
    * parallelogram
    * (calculate the SURFACE AREA of a) cylinder
* HINT: You can probably find the formulas you need online!

* Use f-strings to generate your output strings
* Include the dimensions of the shape (height, width, length of radius, etc.) and the area of the shape in each output string
* In your **areacalcs.py** script, call each function and pass (send) the necessary arguments to your functions
